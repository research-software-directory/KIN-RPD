# Hosting your own RSD

In this section we describe how you can run your own instance of RSD. RSD is open source software. During the release we create docker images for all RSD services and publish them on [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/research-software-directory/packages?repo_name=RSD-as-a-service).

:::tip
If you want to share your research software with the world it is more beneficial to contact us and get access to main RSD instance we are hosting at https://research.software.
