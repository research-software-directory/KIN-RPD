Welcome to the documentation of the [Research Project Directory](https://research-software-directory.org)!

Research software is one of the most important scientific instruments available today. Data-intensive research and computational simulation are the foundation of many scientific
discoveries.

The Research Project Directory (RPD) is a free online platform designed to showcase the impact of research software on research and society. By showing research software together with
relevant contextual information such as scientific publications, contributors, projects, citation information and much more, we stimulate the reuse and encourage proper citation
to ensure the researchers and RSEs developing the software get credit for their work.

## About us

The Research Project Directory was initiated in 2024 by the [KIN](https://hetkin.nl/) as a platform to showcase the research projects developed at our center.
