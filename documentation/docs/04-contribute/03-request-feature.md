# You want to request a feature

To request a feature you can submit an issue on GitHub. Please keep in mind that our development resources are limited, so we may not be able to honor your request.

1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/research-software-directory/RSD-as-a-service/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
2. if you find a similar issue, you can add your own comments and suggestions to this issue (having more people request the same feature may increase its priority);
3. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the feature you are requesting. We may get back to you with further questions.
4. apply the `feature` label; apply other labels when relevant.
