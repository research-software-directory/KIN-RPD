1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/research-software-directory/RSD-as-a-service/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
2. if you find a similar issue, you can add your own comments to this issue;
3. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;
4. apply the `question` label; apply other labels when relevant.
