# You have found a bug

If you find a bug or experience unexpected behaviour, you can submit an issue:

1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/research-software-directory/RSD-as-a-service/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
2. if you find a similar issue, you can add your own comments to this issue;
3. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue and your technical expertise, you may want to include:
    * the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;
    * some identifying information (name and version number) for the version you're using;
    * information about the operating system and browser you are using;
4. apply the `bug` label; apply other labels when relevant.
