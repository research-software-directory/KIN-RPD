# Navigating the RSD

There are many ways to discover interesting research software on the RSD. The main starting points are:

* The search bar (in the header)
* The software overview (reachable by clicking "Discover Software" or the "Software" link in the header)
* The projects overview (reachable by clicking "Projects" in the header)
* The organizations overview (reachable by clicking "Organizations" in the header)

## Global search

Using the search bar in the header, you can perform a global search of all data in the RSD by simply providing a search term.
Currently, the search will match the following fields:

* the name of software, projects and organisations
* the slug of software, projects and organisations
* the keywords of software and projects
* the short description of software
* the subtitle of projects

At the moment, we do not yet match on the long descriptions of software, projects and organisations, but we expect to do so in the future.

## Software Overview

The software overview page provides a list of all software in the RSD. For each software, a __card__ is shown with basic information: name, short description, last update,
number of mentions, and number of contributors. To browse and search for software of interest, the _filter and search_ bar can be used.

Simply typing into the search bar will trigger the RSD to search for software containing (part of) the terms you entered. The name, short description and
keywords are included in the search. Entering multiple words into the search bar will be interpreted as an __AND__. Only software containing all search terms will be shown as a result.

By default, 12 software cards are shown per page. This number can be increased if desired using the __Per page__ dropdown menu.

It is also possible to filter the software by keywords, programming languages and the license. Selecting multiple filter values is interpreted as an __AND__. Only software using all of the selected filters will be shown as a result. You can also combine filters with the search term to further reduce the selection.

## Project Overview
