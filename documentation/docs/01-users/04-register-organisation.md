# Register organisation

If you wish to officially add your organisation to the RSD, or claim an organisation which is already listed but not an official member yet, please contact the
[RSD administrators](mailto:rsd@esciencecenter.nl) and clearly provide the following information:

* Your name.
* Which organisation you represent.

We will then contact you to arrange access for your organisation. Once your organisation is registered,
this will be indicated by a verification checkmark on the card of your organisation:
