## User agreements

To be able to contribute to the RSD, we need to know that you agree to our Terms of Service, and that you have read the Privacy Statement.

## Public profile

If you have ORCID you can link you ORCID account to RSD. There are two benefits of linking ORCID

- You can login to RSD using your ORCID credentials
- You can enable your public profile and see all software and project items that mention you by ORCID

### How the public profile works?

After you link your ORCID account in RSD you can enable your public profile in the settings. By enabling public profile you are giving the permission to RSD to link all contributor and team member entries in the RSD that use your ORCID into your public profile. By enabling the public profile you will be able to see all software and projects where are you mentioned as contributor or team member.
